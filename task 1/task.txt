I want to trigger three relay, (realy 1, relay2, relay3) 
with the help of 2 ultrasonic and 1 Ir proximity sensor.


The working should be as following


Ultrasonic1 if distance < 5cm 
then relay1 high for 1 sec


Ultrasonic2 if distance < 5cm 
then relay2 high for 1 sec


If ir proximity1 sensor high 
then relay3 high for 1 sec


make sure there is a debounce function so that if one sensor is triggered, 
it should not trigger for next 3sec
ah also, after ultransonic relay is triggered, 
don't release the trigger until > 5cm



things i have

uno 1pcs

ultrasonic sensor 2pcs

proximity sensor 1pcs

5v relay 3pcs

bc547 3pcs

10k resistor 3pcs


I want code (with basic comments)  in arduino file and text file. 
I need a schematic as well for knowing how to connect, 
a hand written schematic is also fine.
